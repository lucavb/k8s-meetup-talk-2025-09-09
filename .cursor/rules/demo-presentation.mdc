# Demo and Presentation Guidelines

## Demo Scripts
- Scripts should be executable and well-documented
- Include error handling and cleanup procedures
- Demo scripts are in [aws-demo/scripts/](mdc:aws-demo/scripts/) and [aws-demo/k8s/karpenter-demo/](mdc:aws-demo/k8s/karpenter-demo/)
- Main presentation script: [demo-presentation.sh](mdc:aws-demo/scripts/demo-presentation.sh)

## Presentation Materials
- Slides are in [slides/slides.md](mdc:slides/slides.md) using Slidev format
- Supporting components in [slides/components/](mdc:slides/components/)
- Follow Slidev conventions for slide formatting and navigation

## Demo Flow
- Follow the demo script in [aws-demo/docs/demo-script.md](mdc:aws-demo/docs/demo-script.md)
- Karpenter demos focus on autoscaling and cost optimization
- Include both batch processing and web service scaling scenarios

## Documentation
- Keep README files concise and focused on setup/usage
- Include prerequisites and dependencies clearly
- Provide cleanup instructions to avoid unexpected AWS charges

## Cost Management
- Always include cleanup procedures in demo scripts
- Monitor costs using provided cost-checking scripts
- Document expected costs and resource usage
