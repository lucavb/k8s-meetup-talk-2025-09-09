# Testing Guidelines

## Test Framework
- Use Vitest as the primary testing framework (not Jest)
- Configure Vitest in package.json or vitest.config.ts

## Test File Organization
- Place test files (.spec.ts) next to their source files, not in __tests__ folders
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Group related tests using describe blocks

## Test Structure
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use meaningful assertion messages
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## TypeScript Testing
- Leverage TypeScript types in tests for better type safety
- Use proper typing for test fixtures and mocks
- Ensure tests compile without TypeScript errors

## Demo Testing
- For this demo project, focus on integration tests for critical paths
- Test Kubernetes resource generation if applicable
- Validate configuration files and templates
