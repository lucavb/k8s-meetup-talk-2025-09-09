# General Coding Preferences

## Code Style
- Avoid unnecessary or superfluous comments in code
- Use camelCase for Zod schema names
- Do not include 'prepare' scripts in package.json
- Do not use ts-node for running TypeScript

## Development Workflow  
- Do not automatically start development servers - let the user run them manually
- For infrastructure changes, prefer OpenTofu over manual AWS CLI commands
- Set AWS profiles manually instead of through .env files

## Testing
- Use Vitest as the test framework (not Jest)
- Place test files (.spec.ts) next to their source files, not in __tests__ folders

## Documentation
- In MDC frontmatter, globs field should not be quoted to satisfy Cursor's syntax
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested
